# Pets-services
Website based on react,The website is made with React in a Functional Programming like approach.
Here I create json server that file pasted in Pets-services repositories and I host json server locally in our system to store all dynamic data like customer details, servicedeatils.
Firstly go to json_Api directory in Cmd.
Then we need to start json server using json-server --watch data.json --port 12345 command line.
Running the project go to project directory. run npm to install packages (just a first time).
Run npm start(it runs the app in the development mode and opens http://localhost:3000 automatically to view in the browser)
